    "\n",
    "Using Metacritic’s own [search tool](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/all/filtered?sort=desc), I scraped data to build a large dataframe containing scores, release dates, genres, developers, and publishers of all games across all platforms (at least the games that are in Metacritic). This code generates 2 datasets: the raw one, with nulls and tbd as scores (basically unreviewed games), in case you want absolutely all the data; and the clean one, with all the rows with missing data removed.\n",
