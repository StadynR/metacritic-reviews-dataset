    "# Metacritic Video Game Reviews Scraper\n",
    "\n",
    "*Based on the idea (and a bit of code) from the repository [projectGames](https://github.com/BrunoBVR/projectGames) (2020), but rewritten to account for the current structure of the Metacritic website and to extract the specific data I wanted to collect.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Metacritic’s own [search tool](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/all/filtered?sort=desc), I scraped data to build a large dataframe containing scores, release dates, genres, developers, and publishers of all games across all platforms (at least the games that are in Metacritic). This code generates 2 datasets: the raw one, with nulls and tbd as scores (basically unreviewed games), in case you want absolutely all the data; and the clean one, with all the rows with missing data removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "- httpx + asyncio with concurrency limit.  \n",
    "- Extraction of listings and details (JSON-LD + platforms + scores).  \n",
    "- Incremental saving per page in `pages/`.  \n",
    "- Consolidated DataFrame in `metacritic_dataset.csv`.  \n",
